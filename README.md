# Excel for Business Skills: Essentials

This repository contains my practice work from the **Excel for Business Skills: Essentials** course (part of the Excel for Business Skills Specialization by Macquarie University on Coursera).

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice Excel fundamentals hands-on
- Document my learning week by week
- Maintain consistent GitHub activity while building core spreadsheet skills

This repo is intended as a **learning and practice archive**, not as a portfolio project.
